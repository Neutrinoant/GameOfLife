# GameOfLife
Conway's Game Of Life with C language

This was made on May 5th. 2016, because i was just bored that day.
I've learned several coding techniques from this one day project,
  ● Handling UNICODE
  ● Handling Windows Console
  ● Spliting source and header files
  ● something else...
  
This project is almost done.
Modifying...
